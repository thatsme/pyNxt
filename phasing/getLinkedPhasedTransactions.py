        """
            Gets the phased transactions with by-transaction voting model for a given linkedFullHash,
            regardless of their phasing status (pending, approved or rejected).
            Since the corresponding table is trimmed after finish height however, the result will not include
            those transactions that finished before the last trimming height.

            GetLinkedPhasedTransactions take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with GET method
