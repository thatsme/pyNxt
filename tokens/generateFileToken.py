            Generate a file token. POST only.

            GenerateToken take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Generate_File_Token

            REQUEST
            :param secretPhrase : is the passphrase of the account generating the token
            :param file is the path to the file to be signed

            Note: website is typically a URL (with the leading http:// unnecessary) that an account owner signs with his secretPhrase
            (private key) to bind the account to the URL, but website can be any text that the owner wishes to sign.

            RESPONSE
            :return token (S) is a 160 character string representing the 100-byte token which consists of a 32-byte public key, a 4-byte timestamp, and a 64-byte signature
            :return account (S) is the account number corresponding to secretPhrase
            :return accountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
            :return timestamp (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
            :return valid (B) is true if token is valid, false otherwise
            :return requestProcessingTime (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

                * if you use the secretPhrase , the transaction is immediately broadcasted to network
                ** if you use the publicKey, you create an unsigned Transaction, and you need to sign and broardcast
