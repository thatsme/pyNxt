            Get blocks from the blockchain in reverse block height order.

            GetBlocks take a default 1/3 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Blocks

            REQUEST
            timestamp : is the timestamp (N) (in seconds since the genesis block) of the block (optional if height provided)
            firstIndex : is first block to retrieve (optional, default is zero or the last block on the blockchain)
            lastIndex : is the last block to retrieve (optional, default is firstIndex + 99)
            includeTransactions : is true to include transaction details (B) (O)
            includeExecutedPhased : is true to include approved and executed phased transactions (B) (O)
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

            RESPONSE
            blocks : is an array (A) of blocks retrieved (refer to Get Block for details)
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
