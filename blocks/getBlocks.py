            Get blocks from the blockchain in reverse block height order.

            GetBlocks take a default 1/3 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            API is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Blocks

            REQUEST
            :param timestamp : is the timestamp (N) (in seconds since the genesis block) of the block (optional if height provided)
            :param includeTransactions : is true to include transaction details (B) (O)
            :param includeExecutedPhased : is true to include approved and executed phased transactions (B) (O)
            :param ri : ri object ( check base/Ri.py) (WP)
            :param rb : rb object ( check base/Rb.py) (WP)

            RESPONSE
            :return blocks : is an array (A) of blocks retrieved (refer to Get Block for details)
            :return lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            :return requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
