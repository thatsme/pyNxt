            Get Economic Cluster block data.

            GetECBlock take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_ECBlock

            REQUEST
            timestamp : is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the EC block
                        (optional, default (or zero) is the current timestamp)
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

            Note: If timestamp is more than 15 seconds before the timestamp of the last block on the blockchain, errorCode 4 is returned.

            RESPONSE
            ecBlockHeight (N) is the EC block height
            ecBlockId (S) is the EC block ID
            timestamp : is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the EC block (N)
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
