            :param rateNQT : is the exchange rate (in NQT per QNT) (N)
            :param units : is the amount of the currency to buy or sell (in QNT) (N)
            :param publicKey *: publicKey of sender accounts ( does not get in broadcast )
            :param secretPhrase **: secret Phrase of sender accounts
            :param feeNQT : fee for sending transaction (R) if 0 minimum is set ( 100000000 NQT )
            :param deadLine : is the deadline (in minutes) for the transaction to be confirmed, 32767 minutes maximum ( if 0, 60 )
            :param referencedTransactionFullHash : creates a chained transaction, meaning that the current transaction cannot be confirmed
                                            unless the referenced transaction is also confirmed (O)
            :param broadcast : is set to false to prevent broadcasting the transaction to the network (B) (O)

            Note: An exchange request is immediately executed once accepted onto the blockchain based only on currently
            available offers (refer to Publish Exchange Offer). The request then expires, regardless of the amount of
            currency exchanged; the request may be completely filled, partially filled, or expire without any exchange
            if no matching offers are found.

                * if you use the secretPhrase , the transaction is immediately broadcasted to network
                ** if you use the publicKey, you create an unsigned Transaction, and you need to sign and broardcast
