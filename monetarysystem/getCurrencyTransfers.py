            Get currency transfers given a currency ID and/or an account ID in reverse block height order
            (or in expected order of execution for expected transfers).

            GetCurrencyTransfers take a default 1/5 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            API is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Currency_Transfers

            REQUEST
            :param currency : is the currency ID (S)
            :param account : is an account ID (S)(O)
            :param timestamp : is the earliest transfer (in seconds since the genesis block) to retrieve (optional, does not apply to expected transfers)
            :param includeCurrencyInfo : is true (B) to include some currency fields (optional, does not apply to expected transfers)
            :param ri : ri object ( check base/Ri.py) (WP)
            :param rb : rb object ( check base/Rb.py) (WP)

            RESPONSE
            :return :transfers : (A) is an array of transfer objects with the following fields for each transfer:
            :return > code (S) is the currency code
            :return > units (S) is the amount (in QNT) of the transfer
            :return > issuanceHeight (N) is the blockchain height of the currency issuance for a reservable currency
            :return > type (N) is the currency type bitmask (refer to Get Currency for details)
            :return > issuerAccountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the issuer account
            :return > transfer (S) is the transfer ID
            :return > senderRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the sender account
            :return > sender (S) is the account number of the sender account
            :return > recipientRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the recipient account
            :return > decimals (N) is the number of decimal places used by the currency
            :return > recipient (S) is the account number of the recipient account
            :return > name (S) is the currency name
            :return > currency (S) is the currency ID
            :return > issuerAccount (S) is the issuer account ID
            :return > height (N) is the blockchain height of the transfer
            :return > timestamp (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the transfer block, does not apply to an expected transfer
            :return > phased (B) is true if the transaction is phased, false otherwise, applies only to an expected transfer
            :return > issuerAccountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the issuer account
            :return > issuerAccount (S) is the issuer account ID
            :return requestProcessingTime : (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)
            :return lastBlock : (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
