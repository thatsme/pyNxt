            Make an exchange request to buy or sell an exchangeable currency. POST only.

            CurrencySell take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            :param units : is the amount of the currency to buy or sell (in QNT) (N)

            Note: An exchange request is immediately executed once accepted onto the blockchain based only on currently
            available offers (refer to Publish Exchange Offer). The request then expires, regardless of the amount of
            currency exchanged; the request may be completely filled, partially filled, or expire without any exchange
            if no matching offers are found.

            RESPONSE
            :return signatureHash : is a SHA-256 hash of the transaction signature (S)
            :return unsignedTransactionBytes : are the unsigned transaction bytes (S)
            :return transactionJSON : is a transaction object (O)  (refer to Get Transaction for details)
            :return broadcasted : is true if the transaction was broadcast, false otherwise (B)
            :return requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec)  (N)
            :return transactionBytes :  are the signed transaction bytes (S)
