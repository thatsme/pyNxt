            Publish an exchange offer for an exchangeable currency. POST only.

            PublishExchangeOffer take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Publish_Exchange_Offer

            REQUEST
            :param currency : is the currency ID (S)
            :param buyRateNQT : is the offered buy rate (in NQT per QNT) (N)
            :param sellRateNQT : is the offered sell rate (in NQT per QNT) (N)
            :param totalBuyLimit : is the cumulative limit (in QNT) of currency buys (N)
            :param totalSellLimit : is the cumulative limit (in QNT) of currency sells (N)
            :param initialBuySupply : is the initial amount (in QNT) of currency offered to buy, cannot exceed totalBuyLimit
            :param initialSellSupply : is the initial amount (in QNT) of currency offered to sell, cannot exceed totalSellLimit
            :param expirationHeight : is the blockchain height for expiration of the offer

            :param publicKey *: publicKey of sender accounts ( does not get in broadcast )
            :param secretPhrase **: secret Phrase of sender accounts
            :param feeNQT : fee for sending transaction (R) if 0 minimum is set ( 100000000 NQT )
            :param deadLine : is the deadline (in minutes) for the transaction to be confirmed, 32767 minutes maximum ( if 0, 60 )
            :param referencedTransactionFullHash : creates a chained transaction, meaning that the current transaction cannot be confirmed
                                            unless the referenced transaction is also confirmed (O)
            :param broadcast : is set to false to prevent broadcasting the transaction to the network (B) (O)
            :param phasing : phasing object ( check base/Phasing.py ) (O) (WP)
            :param message : message object ( check base/message.py ) (O) (WP)

            Notes: Each time currency is bought in response to an exchange request to sell currency (refer to Currency Sell),
            totalBuyLimit is reduced and the supply of currency offered to sell increases by the amount bought.
            When totalBuyLimit becomes zero, the buy offer is withdrawn. These same notes apply if buy and sell are interchanged.
            Only the most recent offer associated with an account is valid, even if an earlier offer by that account has not yet
            expired or reached its limits.

            Response: Refer to Create Transaction Response. The transaction ID is also the offer ID.

            RESPONSE
            :return signatureHash : is a SHA-256 hash of the transaction signature (S)
            :return unsignedTransactionBytes : are the unsigned transaction bytes (S)
            :return transactionJSON : is a transaction object (O)  (refer to Get Transaction for details)
            :return broadcasted : is true if the transaction was broadcast, false otherwise (B)
            :return requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec)  (N)
            :return transactionBytes :  are the signed transaction bytes (S)
            :return fullHash : is the full hash of the signed transaction (S)
            :return transaction : is the ID of the newly created transaction (S)
            :return requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (N) (in millisec)

                * if you use the secretPhrase , the transaction is immediately broadcasted to network
                ** if you use the publicKey, you create an unsigned Transaction, and you need to sign and broardcast
