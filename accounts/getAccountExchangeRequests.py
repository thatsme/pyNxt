            Get the exchange requests associated with a given accounts and/or currency in reverse chronological
            order (or in expected order of execution for expected requests).

            GetAccountExchangeRequests take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation
            API is working with GET method

            :param accounts : is the id of accounts (S) (R)
            :param currency : is the currency ID (optional for expected requests if accounts provided)
            :param includeCurrencyInfo : is true to include the response fields
                                    code, decimals, name, issuanceHeight, type, timestamp,

            RESPONSE
            :return exchangeRequests : is an array (A) of requests with the following fields for each request:
            > code (S) is a currency code
            > subtype (N) is 5 for buy and 6 for sell
            > decimals (N) is the number of decimal places
            > name (S) is the currency name
            > units (S) is the number of currency units to buy or sell (in QNT)
            > issuanceHeight (N) is the blockchain height of issuance for a reservable currency, zero otherwise
            > type (N) is the currency type bitmask (refer to Get Currency)
            > transaction (S) is the transaction ID
            > timestamp (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the block when the request was executed
            > rateNQT (S) is the exchange rate (in NQT per QNT)
            > issuerAccountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the issuer accounts
            > issuerAccount (S) is the issuer accounts ID
            > phased (B) is true if the transaction is phased (applies only to expected requests)
            :param lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            :param requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (N) (in millisec)

                * if you use the secretPhrase , the transaction is immediately broadcasted to network
