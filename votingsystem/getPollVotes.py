            REQUEST
            :param poll : is the poll ID
            :param includeWeights : is true to calculate and return the weight assigned to each vote (B) (O)
            :param firstIndex is a zero-based index to the first vote to retrieve (O)
            :param lastIndex is a zero-based index to the last vote to retrieve (O)
            :param requireBlock is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            :param requireLastBlock is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (O)

            RESPONSE
            :return votes : (A) is an array of vote objects (refer to Get Poll Vote for details)
            :return lastBlock : (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            :return requestProcessingTime : (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

            Note: Votes are deleted from the database 1441 blocks after the poll is finished.
            Only aggregate results are kept (refer to Get Poll Result).
