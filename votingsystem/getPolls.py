            Get poll details in reverse creation order.

            GetPolls take a default 1 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation
            Class is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Polls

            REQUEST
            :param account : is a creation account ID filter (O)
            :param timestamp : is the earliest poll (in seconds since the genesis block) to retrieve (O)
            :param firstIndex : is a zero-based index to the first poll to retrieve (O)
            :param lastIndex : is a zero-based index to the last poll to retrieve (O)
            :param includeFinished : is true to include completed polls (B) (O)
            :param finishedOnly is true to exclude not yet executed, phased transactions (O)
            :param requireBlock is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            :param requireLastBlock is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (O)

            RESPONSE
            :return polls (A) is an array of polls (refer to Get Poll for details)
            :return lastBlock (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            :return requestProcessingTime (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)
