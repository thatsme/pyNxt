            Starts a funding monitor that will transfer NXT, ASSET or CURRENCY from the funding account to a recipient account
            when the amount held by the recipient account drops below the threshold.
            The transfer will not be done until the current block height is greater than equal to the block height
            of the last transfer plus the interval. The funding account is identified by the secret phrase.

            The recipient accounts are identified by the specified account property (see Set Account Property).
            Each account that has this property set by the funding account will be monitored for changes.
            The property value can be omitted or it can consist of a JSON string containing one
            or more values in the format: {"amount":long,"threshold":long,"interval":integer}

            StartFoundingMonitor take a default 5 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with POST method only
