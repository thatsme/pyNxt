            REQUEST
            account : is the account ID (O)
            timestamp : is the earliest poll (in seconds since the genesis block) to retrieve (N) (O)
            firstIndex : is a zero-based index to the first block to retrieve (N) (O)
            lastIndex : is a zero-based index to the last block to retrieve (N) (O)
            includeFinished : is true to include completed polls (B) (O)
            finishedOnly : is true to exclude not yet executed, phased transactions (B) (O)
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (S) (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (S) (O)

            RESPONSE
            polls : is an array (A) of polls (refer to Get Poll for details)
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (N) (in millisec)
