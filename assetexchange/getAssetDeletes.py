            asset : is the asset ID (S)
            account : is the account ID (optional if asset is provided)
            firstIndex : is a zero-based index to the first account to retrieve (N) (O)
            lastIndex : is a zero-based index to the last account to retrieve (N) (O)
            timestamp : is the earliest deletion (in seconds since the genesis block) to retrieve (N) (O)
