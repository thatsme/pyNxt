            Get pending phased transactions based on an asset in reverse chronological creation order.
            These transactions can be considered transaction approval requests.

            GetAssetPhasedTransactions take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            API is working with GET method

            :param asset : is the asset ID (S) (R)
            :param accounts : is an accounts ID of the account that created the phased transactions (S) (O)
            :param withoutWhitelist : is true to omit phased transactions that include a whitelist (B) (O)
            :param ri : ri object ( check base/Ri.py) (WP)
