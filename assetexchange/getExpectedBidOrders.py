            Get bid/ask orders given an asset ID, in order of decreasing bid price or increasing ask price

            Class is working with GET method

            REQUEST
            :param asset : is the asset ID (S)
            :param sortByPrice : is true to sort by price (optional, applies only to expected orders,
                        which are returned in expected order of execution by default) (B)
            :param showExpectedCancellations : is true to include orders that are expected to be cancelled in the next block,
                        based on the content of the unconfirmed transactions pool and the phased transactions
                        expected to finish in the next block (optional, does not apply to expected orders) (B)
            :param ri : ri object ( check base/Ri.py) (WP)

            RESPONSE
            :return askOrders : is an array (A) of order objects (refer to Get Order for details) with the following additional field only for an expected order:
            > phased (B) is true if the order is phased, false otherwise
            :return lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
