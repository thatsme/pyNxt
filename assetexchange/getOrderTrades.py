            Get all trades that were executed as a result of a given askOrder and/or bidOrder in reverse block height order.

            GetOrderTrades take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Order_Trades

            REQUEST
            askOrder : is an ask order ID (N) (O)
            bidOrder : is a bid order ID (N) (optional if askOrder provided)
            firstIndex : is a zero-based index to the first trade to retrieve (N) (O)
            lastIndex : is a zero-based index to the last trade to retrieve (N) (O)
            includeCounts : is true if the fields beginning with numberOf... are to be included (B) (O)
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (O)

            RESPONSE
            trades : is an array (A) of trade objects with the following fields for each trade:
            > seller (S) is the account number of the seller
            > quantityQNT (S) is the quantity (in QNT) of the asset traded
            > bidOrder (S) is the bid order ID
            > sellerRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the seller
            > buyer (S) is the account number of the buyer
            > priceNQT (S) is the trade price (in NQT, the ask price for a buy or the bid price for a sell)
            > askOrder (S) is the ask order ID
            > buyerRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the buyer
            > decimals (N) is the number of decimal places used by the asset
            > name (S) is the name of the asset (if includeAssetInfo is true)
            > block (S) is the block ID of the trade (if includeAssetInfo is true)
            > asset (S) is the asset ID
            > askOrderHeight (N) is the block height of the ask order
            > bidOrderHeight (N) is the block height of the bid order
            > tradeType (S) is the trade type (sell or buy, where buy implies that the bid occurred after the ask, or if in the same block, has a greater order ID)
            > timestamp (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the trade block
            > height (N) is the height of the trade block
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
