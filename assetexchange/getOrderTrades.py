            Get all trades that were executed as a result of a given askOrder and/or bidOrder in reverse block height order.

            GetOrderTrades take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            > bidOrder (S) is the bid order ID
            > sellerRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the seller
            > buyer (S) is the accounts number of the buyer
            > priceNQT (S) is the trade price (in NQT, the ask price for a buy or the bid price for a sell)
            > askOrder (S) is the ask order ID
            > buyerRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the buyer
            > decimals (N) is the number of decimal places used by the asset
            > name (S) is the name of the asset (if includeAssetInfo is true)

            > bidOrderHeight (N) is the block height of the bid order
            > tradeType (S) is the trade type (sell or buy, where buy implies that the bid occurred after the ask, or if in the same block, has a greater order ID)
            > timestamp (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the trade block
            > height (N) is the height of the trade block
