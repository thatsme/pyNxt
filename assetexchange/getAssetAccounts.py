            REQUEST
            asset : is the asset ID (S)
            height : is the height of the blockchain to determine the accounts (N) (O) ( default is last block)
            firstIndex : is a zero-based index to the first account to retrieve (N) (O)
            lastIndex : is a zero-based index to the last account to retrieve (N) (O)
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (O)

            Note: If table trimming is enabled (default), the height must be within 1440 blocks of the last block.

            RESPONSE
            accountAssets : is an array (A) of asset objects with the following fields for each asset:
            > quantityQNT : is the quantity (in QNT) of the assets (S)
            > accountRS : is the Reed-Solomon address of the account that own the asset (S)
            > unconfirmedQuantityQNT : is the unconfirmed quantity (in QNT) of the asset (S)
            > asset : is the asset ID (S)
            > account : is the number of the account that own the asset (S)
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
