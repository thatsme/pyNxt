            Get all expected order cancellations in the order in which they are expected to be executed.

            GetExpectedOrderCancellations take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            Class is working with GET method

            https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/The_Nxt_API#Get_Expected_Orcer_Cancellations

            REQUEST
            requireBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (O)
            requireLastBlock : is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (O)

            RESPONSE
            orderCancellations (A) is an array of order cancellation objects with the following fields for each transfer:
            > account (S) is the cancelling account number
            > accountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
            > order (S) is the ID of the order to be cancelled
            > height (N) is the block height of the order cancellation transaction
            > phased (B) is true if the order cancellation transaction is phased
            lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)
