            Get all expected order cancellations in the order in which they are expected to be executed.

            GetExpectedOrderCancellations take a default 1/2 parameter as explained in NXT API Documentation

            API is working with GET method

            REQUEST
            :param rb : rb object ( check base/Rb.py) (WP)

            RESPONSE
            :return orderCancellations (A) is an array of order cancellation objects with the following fields for each transfer:
            > accounts (S) is the cancelling accounts number
            > accountRS (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the accounts
            > order (S) is the ID of the order to be cancelled
            > height (N) is the block height of the order cancellation transaction
            > phased (B) is true if the order cancellation transaction is phased
            :return lastBlock : is the last block ID on the blockchain (S) (applies if requireBlock is provided but not requireLastBlock)
            :return requestProcessingTime : is the API request processing time (in millisec) (N)

                * if you use the secretPhrase , the transaction is immediately broadcasted to network
                ** if you use the publicKey, you create an unsigned Transaction, and you need to sign and broardcast
